## Master Test Script

### Usage

Run ALL tests in the project with a single command:

```bash
bash scripts/run_all_tests_complete.sh
```

### What It Does

1. **Backend Tests** (pytest)
   - Runs unit tests with `-m unit`
   - Runs integration tests with `-m integration`
   - Runs E2E tests with `-m e2e`
   - Falls back to running all tests if no markers found

2. **Frontend Tests** (Jest)
   - Installs dependencies if needed
   - Runs all Jest tests with `--ci --coverage=false`
   - Extracts test count from output

3. **E2E Tests** (Playwright)
   - Uses existing `run_playwright_tests.sh` if available
   - Starts backend server on port 10010
   - Starts frontend server on port 3000
   - Runs Playwright tests
   - Cleans up servers after completion

4. **Final Report**
   - Displays test counts for each category
   - Shows total test count
   - Color-coded success indicators

## Coverage Gaps and Future Enhancements

### Completed ✅
- ✅ Real-time collaboration testing
- ✅ Profile management testing
- ✅ Room settings and permissions testing
- ✅ Navigation flow testing
- ✅ Error handling and recovery testing
- ✅ Utility function testing (auth, username, user, notify)
- ✅ Master test automation script

### Remaining Opportunities
- ⚠️ Component tests (Canvas, Dashboard) - pending react-router-dom v7 module resolution
- ⚠️ Service tests (socket.js, canvasBackendJWT.js) - complex Socket.IO mocking required
- ⚠️ Increase backend coverage from 27% to 40%+
- ⚠️ Cross-browser testing (Firefox, WebKit)
- ⚠️ Mobile viewport testing
- ⚠️ Performance testing
- ⚠️ Accessibility testing (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- ⚠️ Load testing and stress testing

---

## Test Quality Standards

### All Tests Must
1. ✅ Be independent and isolated
2. ✅ Clean up after themselves
3. ✅ Use proper mocking for external dependencies
4. ✅ Have clear, descriptive test names
5. ✅ Test both success and failure cases
6. ✅ Handle edge cases
7. ✅ Be deterministic (no flaky tests)
8. ✅ Run quickly (< 30 seconds per test for E2E, < 1 second for unit tests)

### Code Coverage Goals
- **Backend**: 27% → Target 40%+ (pytest --cov)
- **Frontend**: High coverage for critical paths (Jest --coverage)
- **E2E**: All user-facing features covered

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Playwright tests failing with "Element not found"**
- Solution: Increase timeouts, add explicit waits

**Jest tests failing with "Cannot find module"**
- Solution: Check import paths, ensure proper mocking

**Backend tests failing with "Connection refused"**
- Solution: Ensure Redis and MongoDB are running

**Master script stops mid-execution**
- Solution: Check for syntax errors in test files, review logs

---

## Summary

### What Was Achieved

✅ **Created 137+ new tests** across frontend and E2E testing
✅ **Added 5 new Playwright E2E test files** (50 new tests)
✅ **Added 4 new Jest utility test files** (87 new tests)
✅ **Created master test automation script** (`run_all_tests_complete.sh`)
✅ **Enhanced CI/CD workflow** with smoke test
✅ **Total test count: 319+ tests** (99 backend + 141 frontend + 79+ E2E)

### Test Coverage Highlights

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user synchronization, presence, concurrent editing
- **Profile Management**: Password changes, preferences, validation
- **Room Settings**: Permissions, ownership transfer, member management
- **Navigation**: Routing, deep linking, browser history
- **Error Handling**: Network failures, API errors, recovery mechanisms
- **Utilities**: Auth, username/user resolution, notifications

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `bash scripts/run_all_tests_complete.sh` to verify all tests pass
2. ⚠️ Fix component tests (react-router-dom module resolution)
3. ⚠️ Add service tests if needed (Socket.IO mocking)
4. ✅ Monitor CI/CD pipeline for any failures
5. ✅ Continue adding tests as new features are developed
