"""
Cleanup script to remove owner share records that were incorrectly created before the bug fixes.
Owners should only be identified by room.ownerId, not by share records in shares_coll.

This script:
1. Finds all rooms
2. For each room, checks if the owner has a share record
3. Deletes any owner share records found
4. Reports statistics
