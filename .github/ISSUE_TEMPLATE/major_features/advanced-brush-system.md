title: "Advanced Brush System: Wacky Brushes, Mixer Filters, and Rubber Stamps"
labels: ["enhancement", "frontend", "advanced", "help wanted"]
---

### Description
Currently, the canvas supports basic freehand and shape drawing. We want a rich brush/filter/stamp system inspired by classic drawing apps (Kid Pix / Tux Paint) — a set of creative brushes (wacky brushes with effects and repeat stamps), a Mixer (global image filters/effects), and a Rubber Stamp tool with an editable stamp library.

### Current Workflow
- Users can draw freehand shapes and simple shapes on the canvas.
- No plug-in style brush/effects system, no global filters, and no stamp library.

### Proposed Solution
Implement an extensible brush plugin system, a Mixer tool with preview and non-destructive application (undoable), and a Stamp tool with a built-in stamp library and a simple stamp editor.

### Technical Requirements
#### Files to Create:
- `frontend/src/components/BrushEditor/BrushPanel.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/BrushEditor/WackyBrushPreview.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Mixer/MixerPanel.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Stamps/StampPanel.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Stamps/StampEditor.jsx`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useBrushEngine.js`
- `frontend/src/styles/brushes.css`

#### Files to Modify:
- `Canvas.js` (integrate brush engine, new brush palette, render preview)
- `Toolbar.js` (add controls for Brushes/Mixer/Stamps)
- `drawing.js` (add support for stroke meta describing brush type / stamp placement / filter markers)
- `canvasBackendJWT.js` (if stamps or brushes should be saved/loaded to server)

#### Optional Backend (for persistence/catalogs):
- `backend/routes/stamps.py` (CRUD for stamp library)
- `db.py` (add stamps collection usage)

### Skills Needed
- Advanced React/JS (state, hooks, performant canvas rendering)
- 2D canvas rendering & compositing
- UX design for tool palettes
- Optional: Express/Flask + MongoDB CRUD

### Difficulty
Advanced

### Key Features to Implement
- Brush plugin architecture (brush id, params, preview render function)
- Several built-in fancy brushes (Wacky Brush: pattern trails, dripping effects, shape scatter brush)
- Mixer tool applying non-destructive filters (blur, hue shift, chalk, fade) with preview and undo
- Rubber Stamp tool with library (PNG/SVG stamps), scaling/rotate, editable stamps (simple crop/scale)
- Stamp import/export (zip or single image)
- Keyboard shortcuts and undo/redo integration
- Performance optimization for large canvases (tiling, batching)

### Technical Challenges
- High-performance rendering for particle/trail brushes on large canvases
- Non-destructive filter application while retaining undo/redo semantics
- Handling stamp assets (storage, caching, memory)
- UI/UX complexity for many brush options without overwhelming users

### Getting Started
1. Fork, feature branch: `feature/advanced-brushes`
2. Implement the brush engine hook + preview component
3. Add the UI panels and wire them to `Canvas.js`
4. Add a couple of sample brushes and a Mixer filter
5. If persistence desired, add backend stamps route + simple CRUD
6. Add tests for brush param serialization and Mixer’s non-destructive behavior

### Tests to Add
- **Unit**: brush param → canonical serialized metadata (happy path + invalid params)
- **Integration**: applying a Mixer filter then undo returns original buffer
- **UI**: stamp import → appears in library and can be placed onto canvas
- **Performance**: rendering 100 small stamp placements without dropping frame budget

### Resources
- MDN Canvas API
- Example brush algorithms (scatter brush, line-following particle trails)
