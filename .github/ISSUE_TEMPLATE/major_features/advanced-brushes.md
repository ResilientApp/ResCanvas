## Description

Add a robust, extensible brush plugin system with several creative brushes (Wacky Brush, scatter/shape trails), a Mixer tool for non-destructive filters, and a Rubber Stamp library (importable stamps, editor).

## Current workflow

- Canvas supports basic freehand and shape drawing but lacks expressive brushes, global filters, and stamps.

## Proposed solution

- Build a brush engine, UI panels for brush editing and preview, Mixer with non-destructive preview/apply, and a stamp manager with import/export.

## Technical requirements

Files to create:
- `frontend/src/components/BrushEditor/BrushPanel.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/BrushEditor/WackyBrushPreview.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Mixer/MixerPanel.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Stamps/StampPanel.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Stamps/StampEditor.jsx`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useBrushEngine.js`
- `frontend/src/styles/brushes.css`

Files to modify:
- `frontend/src/components/Canvas.js` (integrate engine and preview rendering)
- `frontend/src/components/Toolbar.js` (add Brushes/Mixer/Stamps controls)
- `frontend/src/lib/drawing.js` (extend stroke meta to include brush params)
- `frontend/src/services/canvasBackendJWT.js` (persist brush presets/stamps if desired)

Optional backend for persistence:
- `backend/routes/stamps.py` CRUD for stamp library

Skills: Advanced React, Canvas compositing, brush algorithms, optional backend CRUD

Difficulty: Advanced

## Key features

- Brush plugin architecture and preview
- Built-in wacky brushes (drip, scatter, pattern trails)
- Mixer filters with preview and undo
- Rubber Stamp library (import PNG/SVG, scale/rotate, edit)
- Performance optimizations for large canvases

## Technical challenges

- High-performance rendering for particle/brush effects
- Non-destructive filter semantics with undo/redo
- Stamp asset storage and caching

## Getting started

1. Create the brush engine hook and preview component
2. Add a simple Wacky Brush and a Mixer blur filter
3. Add UI panels and integrate with `Canvas.js`
4. Optionally add backend stamp persistence and CRUD

## Tests to add

- Unit: brush param serialization
- Integration: Mixer apply/undo consistency
- Performance: high-frequency brush stroke rendering
