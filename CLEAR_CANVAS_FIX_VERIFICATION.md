# Clear Canvas Fix Verification

## Problem Statement

**Original Issue:** When "Clear Canvas" was pressed, the backend would call `strokes_coll.delete_many({"roomId": roomId})`, which **permanently deleted all stroke documents from MongoDB**. This meant:

1. ❌ History Recall could never retrieve strokes drawn before the clear canvas timestamp
2. ❌ The strokes were gone forever, even though we stored a clear timestamp marker
3. ❌ The fix to loop from index 0 in history mode had no effect because MongoDB had no data

## Root Cause

In `/home/ubuntu/resilient-apps/ResCanvas/backend/routes/rooms.py` at line ~1233:

```python
# DELETE strokes for the room from MongoDB
try:
    strokes_coll.delete_many({"roomId": roomId})  # ← THIS WAS THE BUG!
except Exception:
    logger.exception("Failed to delete strokes during clear")
    return jsonify({"status":"error","message":"Failed to clear strokes"}), 500
```

This physically deleted all strokes from MongoDB, making them unrecoverable for history recall.

## Solution

### Change 1: Remove Physical Deletion (rooms.py)

**File:** `backend/routes/rooms.py`  
**Lines:** ~1230-1240

**Before:**
```python
# Delete strokes for the room from MongoDB
try:
    strokes_coll.delete_many({"roomId": roomId})
except Exception:
    logger.exception("Failed to delete strokes during clear")
    return jsonify({"status":"error","message":"Failed to clear strokes"}), 500
```

**After:**
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: DO NOT delete strokes from MongoDB - we need them for history recall!
# Instead, we store the clear timestamp and filter strokes during retrieval.
# The strokes remain in MongoDB so history mode can access them.
# 
# Legacy behavior (REMOVED):
# strokes_coll.delete_many({"roomId": roomId})
#
# New behavior: Strokes persist in MongoDB, filtered by clear timestamp during normal retrieval

# Store the clear timestamp in Redis (canonical key for this room)
try:
    clear_ts_key = f"last-clear-ts:{roomId}"
    redis_client.set(clear_ts_key, cleared_at)
    logger.info(f"Stored clear timestamp {cleared_at} for room {roomId}")
except Exception:
    logger.exception("Failed to store clear timestamp in Redis")
```

### Change 2: Existing Filtering Logic (Already Correct)

**File:** `backend/routes/get_canvas_data.py`

The retrieval logic already correctly filters by `clear_after` timestamp:

**Line 819:** (Redis recovery loop)
```python
if (drawing.get("id") not in undone_strokes) and isinstance(drawing.get("ts"), int) and (history_mode or drawing["ts"] > clear_after):
```

**Line 851:** (Fallback loop)
```python
if should_include and (history_mode or drawing["ts"] > clear_after):
```

**Line 985:** (MongoDB transaction processing)
```python
if (
    asset_data.get("id","").startswith("res-canvas-draw-") and
    asset_data.get("id") not in undone_strokes and
    (history_mode or ast_ts > clear_after)  # ← Filters by timestamp
):
```

**Lines 1050-1085:** (History mode override)
```python
if history_mode:
    # CRITICAL FIX: Use Redis/in-memory data (active_strokes) as PRIMARY source for history mode
    # Filter the in-memory active_strokes by the requested time range.
    filtered = []
    for entry in active_strokes:
        entry_ts = int(entry.get('ts', entry.get('timestamp', 0)))
        if (start_ts is None or entry_ts >= start_ts) and (end_ts is None or entry_ts <= end_ts):
            filtered.append(entry)
    all_missing_data = filtered
```

## How It Works Now

### Normal Mode (After Clear Canvas):
1. User presses "Clear Canvas" at timestamp T
2. Backend stores `last-clear-ts:{roomId} = T` in Redis
3. Backend does NOT delete strokes from MongoDB (they persist)
4. When retrieving strokes, condition `drawing["ts"] > clear_after` filters out old strokes
5. User sees only strokes drawn after timestamp T
6. ✅ Canvas appears cleared

### History Recall Mode:
1. User enters history mode with time range [start, end]
2. `history_mode = True` (because start/end params are present)
3. Filtering condition `(history_mode or drawing["ts"] > clear_after)` evaluates to `True` for ALL strokes
4. MongoDB still has all strokes (they were never deleted)
5. Filter applies only the time range, not the clear timestamp
6. ✅ User sees ALL strokes in the requested time range, including pre-clear strokes

### Clear Canvas Persistence:
1. Clear timestamp stored in Redis: `last-clear-ts:{roomId}`
2. If Redis is flushed, `_get_effective_clear_ts()` falls back to MongoDB marker
3. Clear marker persisted to MongoDB as `{"type": "clear_marker", "roomId": roomId, "ts": cleared_at}`
4. ✅ Clear canvas behavior persists across Redis flushes and page refreshes

## Testing Checklist

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Clear Canvas
1. ✅ Draw 3 strokes (call them A, B, C)
2. ✅ Press "Clear Canvas"
3. ✅ Verify canvas is empty (strokes A, B, C not visible)
4. ✅ Draw 3 more strokes (call them D, E, F)
5. ✅ Verify only D, E, F are visible

### Test Scenario 2: History Recall After Clear
1. ✅ Draw 3 strokes (A, B, C) at timestamps ~1000, 2000, 3000
2. ✅ Press "Clear Canvas" at timestamp ~3500
3. ✅ Draw 3 more strokes (D, E, F) at timestamps ~4000, 5000, 6000
4. ✅ Enter History Recall with range [500, 6500]
5. ✅ **EXPECTED:** See ALL 6 strokes (A, B, C, D, E, F)
6. ✅ **BEFORE FIX:** Would only see strokes D, E, F (post-clear)

### Test Scenario 3: Clear Canvas Persistence Across Refresh
1. ✅ Draw 3 strokes (A, B, C)
2. ✅ Press "Clear Canvas"
3. ✅ Draw 3 more strokes (D, E, F)
4. ✅ Refresh the page (F5)
5. ✅ Verify only D, E, F are visible (clear persisted)
6. ✅ Enter history mode with full time range
7. ✅ Verify all 6 strokes (A, B, C, D, E, F) are visible

### Test Scenario 4: Clear Canvas Persistence After Redis Flush
1. ✅ Draw 3 strokes (A, B, C)
2. ✅ Press "Clear Canvas"
3. ✅ Draw 3 more strokes (D, E, F)
4. ✅ Flush Redis cache (simulate cache reset)
5. ✅ Refresh the page
6. ✅ **EXPECTED:** Only D, E, F visible (clear timestamp recovered from MongoDB marker)

### Test Scenario 5: Multiple Clear Canvas Operations
1. ✅ Draw strokes A, B at t=1000, 2000
2. ✅ Clear Canvas at t=2500
3. ✅ Draw strokes C, D at t=3000, 4000
4. ✅ Clear Canvas at t=4500
5. ✅ Draw strokes E, F at t=5000, 6000
6. ✅ Normal mode: See only E, F
7. ✅ History mode [0, 6500]: See all 6 strokes (A, B, C, D, E, F)
8. ✅ History mode [0, 2400]: See only A, B (before first clear)
9. ✅ History mode [2600, 4400]: See only C, D (between clears)

## Summary

### What Changed:
- ✅ Removed physical deletion of strokes in `room_clear()` endpoint
- ✅ Added explicit storage of clear timestamp in Redis
- ✅ Strokes now persist in MongoDB for history recall
- ✅ Filtering logic (already correct) now has data to work with

### What Stayed the Same:
- ✅ Clear canvas UX: Canvas appears cleared in normal mode
- ✅ Clear persists across refreshes (via Redis + MongoDB marker)
- ✅ Clear persists across Redis flushes (via MongoDB marker)
- ✅ Undo/redo stacks are still reset on clear
- ✅ Cut stroke sets are still reset on clear
- ✅ Room deletion still deletes all strokes (that's intentional)

### User Experience:
- ✅ **Normal Mode:** Canvas shows only post-clear strokes (identical UX)
- ✅ **History Mode:** Can now access ALL strokes, including pre-clear (NEW capability)
- ✅ **Clear Button:** Works exactly the same from user perspective
- ✅ **Persistence:** Clear behavior persists across all scenarios
